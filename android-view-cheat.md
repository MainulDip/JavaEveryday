## Android-View Mini Docs:
Android View elements are mostly self explanatory. So just some minimal quick start and overview will be good.

### Layout Type:
> Relative | Constraint | Linear | 

> Linear: Elements placed one after one. Can set orientation vertical/horizontal. Attributes: layout_weight, background etc. Inside LinearLayout, Relative and Constraint Layout are also placeable.

> Constraint: Better to work on Design view rather than xml editor. Options: baseline alignment, precise positioning using layout slider (horizontal/vertical), constraint to guideline (help->guideline), image ratio placeholder with constraint element.

### Vectors & Images:
Add vectors through the res/drawable and images through res/minimap.

### Adapters: ArrayAdapter | 
used to inject data to listview or recycler view.
